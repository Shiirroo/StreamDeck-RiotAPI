# StreamDeck-RiotAPI
 It is an unofficial plugin that takes the Riot Games API to let you display information about LOL / LOR / VR / TF

## Installing plugin

**Note:** The installation and use of plugins is done at your own risk.

1. Make sure you're on the latest version of the Stream Deck software by checking for updates in the app.
2. Browse the list below. When you find a plugin you like, hit the 'Download' link to be taken to the list of releases. Pick the most recent version (generally the best option), which will download a '.streamDeckPlugin' file to your computer.
3. Open the new file by double-clicking on it, or launching from your browser. The Stream Deck app will open, and the new plugin will have loaded one or more actions under the 'Riot Games API' header at the bottom-right. Drag the new action onto your Stream Deck and get streaming!

### Press it for updates or wait!

If you press the Action key, you will get the updated Riot Games API condition instantly! Otherwise, the Riot Games API is automatically updated by your refresh settings. 

#### `Title`

Do not set the title, and leave it empty! The title is automatically set with the current Action condition.

#### `Automatic Refresh`

If you want the Riot Games API information to be loaded when the actions are loaded, turn on this setting. 
The times when the automatic refresh will be triggered:

1. StreamDeck is restarting.
2. Switching profiles.
